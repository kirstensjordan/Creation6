//A program to practice working with multi-dimensional arrays

//Credit goes to an Anonymous person who answered this question online. I will try to apply my understanding of the program that anonymous posted to the starting point code you have provided and make my own interpretation.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Research Input data: go to http://www.weather.comLinks to an external site.

//Pick two cities of your choice. Fill in the temperature for the 7 days of this week of both cities. Fill in this text data table, which will be used in your program.

//City_One = 1, City_Two = 2  
//Replace City_One and City_Two with the names of your cities
//SanAntonio = 1, Haslet = 2

//Data Table
//City X, Day X: Temp

int main()
{
  const int CITY=2;
  const int WEEK=7;
  int temperature[CITY][WEEK];
  //Note your input data from the above
  cout<<"Enter all temperature for a week of City 1 and then City 2.\n";
  //Inserting the values into the temperature array
  //Note for every dimension of the array you need a for loop 2 dimensions=2 for loops

  for (int i=0; i<CITY;++i)
    {
      for (int j=0;j<WEEK; ++j)
        {
          cout<<"City "<<i+1<<", Day "<<j+1<<": ";
          cin>>temperature[i][j];
        }

  //Accessing the values from the temperature array
  for (int i=0; i<CITY;++i)

    }
  //For up to 5 Points Extra Credit
  //Expand this program:
  //1. Create a one dimensional array, cityOne[7] to store the 7 temperatures of city 1, assume that value 0 represents day 1, 1 represents day 2....
  //2. Create a on dimensional array, cityTwo[7] to store the 7 temperatures of city 2 , assume that value 0 represents day 1, 1 represents day 2....
  //3. Using a for loop (or nested for loop), feed the data of CityOne[] and CityTwo[] into temperature[i][j], where i is index of the City Number, and j is the index of the temp for the day.
  //4. print the results of temperature[i][j]; to the screen.
